# Notes

- Hyper (i.e. Command + Control + Option) is defined via Karabiner-Elements. Caps Lock is mapped to Hyper when held down, Escape when tapped.

# TODO

### Window Management:
- fancyzones-like visual grids
    - keybinding creates a grid, shows overlay
    - other keybinding snaps all open windows to closest grid square
- key bindings:
    - `hyper+h` : First part of key-chord for snapping to the left...
        - `h`   : Snap to the nearest left-ward box in current grid
    - `hyper+j` : First part of key-chord for snapping downward...
        - `j`   : Snap to the nearest down-ward box in current grid
    - `hyper+k` : First part of key-chord for snapping upward...
        - `k`   : Snap to the nearest up-ward box in current grid
    - `hyper+l` : First part of key-chord for snapping to the right...
        - `l`   : Snap to the nearest right-ward box in current grid
