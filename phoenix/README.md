My config of [Phoenix](https://kasper.github.io/phoenix/), intended to replace Hammerspoon. Hammerspoon is amazing but I really dislike Lua -- Phoenix's use of JavaScript/TypeScript/etc is very attractive.

As of now, I'm just using JavaScript in a single `phoenix.js` file, but ideally I'd like to:
- Rewrite in TypeScript, 
- with multiple files, and
- *compile* down to a single `phoenix.js` file.
