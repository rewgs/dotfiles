For this to work, System Settings/Keyboard/Keyboard Shortcuts/Modifier Keys/Caps Lock must NOT be remapped -- just leave it alone.

This config also leaves Caps Lock intact -- simply tap both left and right Shift keys simultaneously. Credit to [this issue](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/1233) for the code.
