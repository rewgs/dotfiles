Using [kanshi](https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/kanshi) to hot-reload monitors

# TODO
- Win+1 should:
    - switch to workspace 1 when focused window is on built-in display
    - switch to workspace 11 when focused window is on Dell display
    - etc for 2/12, 3/13, etc...
- Workspace 0: scratchpad
    - also -- look into if Hyprland does that natively?
