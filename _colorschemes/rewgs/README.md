# notes
- Colors needed: 
    - a proper white
    - red_dark
    - second (darker) grey
- Black is too grey. As it is now, the black and blue give 70s Batman vibes. No good.
- Black and red are hard to read.
- Green and cyan are nice, but could be a bit more "themselves" (i.e. green be more green, cyan more actually cyan, etc). Blue needs to be a touch more faded. As it is now, green and cyan are a touch too "gruvbox," and blue is a bit too "onedark."
- Magenta is working
- The grey we have is good, just need a second one.
- Need a whole second set of colors -- gruvbox calls the originals "brights" and this new group "faded" -- I like that for this color scheme. They're darker, yes, but also less saturated.
- Also make the following alts:
    - brighter
    - darker
    - oled (black is #000000)
    - light
    - light faded? easier on the eyes
- Haven't yet seen orange used...no notes on it. Any 

- oled version in general needs to be more faded. All colors are a touch too bright, except maybe magenta.
