This folder contains configs for plugins that, for one reason or another, aren't being used at the moment. As `lazy.lua` does not look in this directory, all `.lua` files here are ignored by it.

[`accelerated-jk.lua`](./accelerated-jk.lua): No matter what I do, Lazy just won't install this/be happy with the config.

[`bufferline.lua`](./bufferline.lua): I like and want to dig into more in the future, but don't love their current state or config.
