This is a still-in-progress new version of `fresh-install`; use that for now, and tread carefully here.


# TODO:
- make ssh key, add to github account via `gh`
- make it so that this can all run in one go, i.e. can continue past `exec $SHELL`
- copy or symlink my tmux theme to ~/.tmux/plugins, and/or don't use the onedark package anymore?
- add installation of `lf`
