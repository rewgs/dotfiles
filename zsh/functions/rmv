# Like rm, but works the same for both files and directories (i.e. rmv file and rmv directory both 
# work). Always confirms before deletion.

function rmv () {
    for arg in "$@"; do
        if [[ -d "$arg" ]]; then
            rm -rfI "$arg"
        else
            rm -i "$arg"
        fi
    done
}
