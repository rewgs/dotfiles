I prefer to use only one display. Plus, my Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 11 has an OLED display -- when I'w working at my desk on my external display, I neither want nor need (to prevent burn-in) anything on my laptop display.

`kanshi` is executed at login by `hyprland` via `exec-once`. 

When I plug in my external display, the laptop display turns off.

When I unplug from the external display, the laptop display turns back on.
